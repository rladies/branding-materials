# Youtube channel

R-Ladies Global has a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RLadiesGlobal) where we post videos from different chapters around the world. 
Some chapters run their own channels, which are subscribed by the global channel, so it's easy to find more related content. 

If you run an R-Ladies chapter and have a video of a meetup you want hosted on the Global channel, contact @mo in the R-Ladies organisers slack or in the community slack. 
She will need a google account name, which will be added as a manager of the channel for you to upload the video. 
Since not all chapters run in English, this will also make it possible for you to add description of the content, credit to the speaker etc.

## Title
the title should have three main parts  
    1. the chapter name (R-Ladies Freiburg)  
        - remember to check the hyphens are correct
    2. language of the content (English)  
    3. title of the talk
    ex. R-Ladies Freiburg (English) - Rmarkdown 

## Description
The description can be written in either the content language or in English, that is up to you, but we recommend writing it in the content language. 
Make sure to describe the content of the video so viewers can understand what the have in store. 
Usually the event description is a good thing to add here. 

Please give proper credit to your speaker, make sure their name is spelled correctly and you are using the correct pronouns. 
Also link to their online presence if they have one and want you to, talk to them about what type of credit they would like to be given for the talk. 

If the slides for the presentation or other materials from the talk are available online (like on github or the like) please also link to those, so the interested viewer can follow along interactively. 

If you have had questions asked during the talk, and the speaker has pointed to online resources etc that are not in the slides, try to find them and post them in the description section. 

Try to think about what type of information you would find practical to find in the description and try to fullfil that.

## Other Youtube settings
There are a couple other settings for the video that are ideal to set correctly.
They are usually hidden under "more options" settings.

- The date of the recording  
- The language of the recording  
    - this helps YT algorithms and also the autocaptioning if it is one of the lanugages YT offers automatic captions top
- Add the video to playlists for the language the content is in  
    - we try to make playlists with content in the same language, making it easier for those interested in content in a specific language to find it  

If you are struggling with upload, writing the description etc, contact @mo again in any of the two slack communitites mentioned above, and she'll help you out.
