# R-Ladies Starter Kit for New Chapters

## Overview of R-Ladies Global

### **Mission** : R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community.

- **Leadership**: 
  Leadership roles within R-Ladies chapters, particularly Organizer and Mentor roles, are to be held by _women and gender     minorities_.
- **Accessibility**:
  Provision of FREE events based on a combination of volunteering and
  funding/sponsorship where available.
- **No commercial agenda**:
 Chapters are started by individuals, not by companies.  Chapters can partner with companies for sponsorship in the form of venue space, food or other supplies.  Chapters and events may not be ‘used’ by a corporation/as a commercial vehicle for private aims. This also means that **speakers cannot give talks about paid products/services**, even if they don't work at the company offering the product/service.

  R-Ladies is registered as California-based non-profit corporation, run by the Global Leadership team.
